# visualizeCSV
This is my first project and it might have many bugs and it's also not fully functional. It lets you take a CSV file(from predefined ones which were made for testing purposes, I'll upload them as well. However it can be made dynamic or the file path can be changed in the code) and perform CRUD operations on it and also helps you to visualise it using animated bar graph and pie chart. All of this is implemented using C++.
